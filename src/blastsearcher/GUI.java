	 * This class is for the GUI.
	 * Data could be copypasted into two columns of Sequence ID and Sequence,
	 * and come out looking like the base Excel file.
	 * After that, pressing submit and getting a confirmation would do.
	 * A progress bar and current progress, as well as a cancel button would be nice.
	 * 
	 * General proposed layout:
	 * 
	 *  Sequence IDs     Sequences
	 * ____________   _______________
